            A <b><strong>blockchain</strong></b> is a type of <mark>distributed ledger technology (DLT)</mark> that
            <del>consists</del> include of growing list of records, called blocks, that are securely linked together
            using
            cryptography.<sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup> Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a
            timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by
            leaves). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was created. Since each block
            contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data
            structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions
            are
            irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively
            without altering all subsequent blocks.

            <br>Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as a public
            distributed
            ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new
            transaction
            blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains
            may be
            considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault
            tolerance.[5]

                Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer
                Systems
                Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups."[11] Further work on a
                cryptographically
                secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.[4][12] They wanted
                to
                implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta,
                and
                Dave
                Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several
                document
                certificates to be collected into one block.[4][13] Under their company Surety, their document
                certificate
                hashes have been published in The New York Times every week since 1995.[14]

                The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi
                Nakamoto
                in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to timestamp
                blocks
                without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to
                stabilize
                the
                rate at which blocks are added to the chain.[4] The design was implemented the following year by
                Nakamoto as
                a
                core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions
                on
                the
                network.[3]

                In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have
                occurred
                on
                the network, reached 20 GB (gigabytes).[15] In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and
                from
                January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size. The ledger size
                had
                exceeded 200 GB by early 2020.[16]

                The words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper, but were eventually
                popularized as a single word, blockchain, by 2016.[17]

                According to Accenture, an application of the diffusion of innovations theory suggests that blockchains
                attained
                a 13.5% adoption rate within financial services in 2016, therefore reaching the early adopters'
                phase.[18]
                Industry trade groups joined to create the Global Blockchain Forum in 2016, an initiative of the Chamber
                of
                Digital Commerce.

                In May 2018, Gartner found that only 1% of CIOs indicated any kind of blockchain adoption within their
                organisations, and only 8% of CIOs were in the short-term "planning or [looking at] active
                experimentation
                with
                blockchain".[19] For the year 2019 Gartner reported 5% of CIOs believed blockchain technology was a
                'game-changer' for their business.<sup>[20]</sup>
